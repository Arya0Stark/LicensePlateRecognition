## The process for running the code is as follows- ##

- run final.m and lic.m in Matlab first
- The result will be an image file- new.jpg
- Place new.jpg in opened zip folder-OCRmodule.

*Make sure you have installed the image processing toolbox in Matlab*

- remove clear all from create_template
- -run ocr.m

final.m splits the frames from the video, lic.m decides the final image to be analyzed among the frames, and the OCRmodule contains the code for creating templates, lines, reading letters and complete character recognition.

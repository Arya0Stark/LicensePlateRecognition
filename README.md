## License Plate Recognition ##
A project done to recognize the numbers from the frame of license plate captured in single plane traffic with the help of course knowledge of Digital Image Processing.

The aim is optical character recognition in license plates without the use of highly expensive motion sensing cameras. This would ensure that we can take a video of the required license plate, with even a meagre spectral imaging device, and the program would still create frames for it and we can have a higher chance at the accuracy of detection of the numbers, all in a completely cost-efficient manner.

The code (using Matlab) along with instructions on how to run it and the video pf the license plate fed into it are present in the Code folder.

The theoretical details as well as execution snapshots are enclosed in the document, along with a detailed purpose.
